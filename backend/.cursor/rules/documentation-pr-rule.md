# Documentation PR Creation Rule

## Trigger
When asked to create documentation PRs, submit PRs on GitHub, or create comprehensive documentation pull requests.

## Actions

### 0. Issue Identification
**If not apparent, ask the user what issues are relevant to the PR if possible.**
- Check if the PR addresses specific GitHub issues
- Request issue numbers or descriptions from the user
- Link relevant issues in the PR description

### 1. Branch and Diff Detection
**If you don't have the current branch name or target branch, ask the user if they want to provide the current branch name and the target branch. If not, you can figure it out yourself.**
- Ask user for current branch and target branch if not apparent
- Use git commands to detect current branch if user doesn't provide
- Default to "main" as target branch unless specified otherwise
- **At the first chance you get, get the git diff either from commands you have access to using cursor, or using the terminal**

### 2. User Questions
**Ask the user some questions about the PR if you can:**
- What is the main purpose of this PR?
- Are there any breaking changes?
- What should reviewers focus on?
- Any special deployment considerations?
- What testing has been done?

### 3. PR Title Format
Use emoji-enhanced titles with clear categorization:
```
📚 [Main Feature] & [Secondary Feature] 
```
Examples:
- `📚 Comprehensive Wiki Enhancement & Secret Management System`
- `📖 API Documentation Update & Framework Guides`

### 4. PR Description Structure
Always include this exact header note:
```
> Generated by Cursor AI Assistant. Save a rule like this: "When asked to create documentation PRs, include comprehensive descriptions with emoji categorization, detailed change summaries, and proper GitHub formatting."
```

Then follow this template:

   - Full formatted description

- **Professional formatting** with consistent styling

### 7. Technical Requirements
